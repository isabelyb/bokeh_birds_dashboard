# Birds Dashboard made with Pandas and Bokeh
This is a project to try pandas_bokeh for Dashboards.
I am following data about fruits the birds come to eat in my window 🐦.

## Requirements and Installation

#### Bokeh
The easiest way to install Bokeh is using the Anaconda Python distribution and its included Conda package management system. To install Bokeh and its required dependencies, enter the following command at a Bash or Windows command prompt:
```
conda install bokeh 
```
To install using pip, enter the following command at a Bash or Windows command prompt:
```
pip install bokeh
```
For more information, refer to the [installation documentation](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/installation.html).

#### Pandas_Bokeh
Via pip:
```
pip install pandas-bokeh
```
or conda:
```
conda install -c patrikhlobil pandas-bokeh
```
Pandas Bokeh is officially supported on Python 3.5 and above.

## Data

I have been collecting data from the quantity of fruit I put in my window every day. A lot of birds come to eat it and I love it!   
This is [the post](http://tangaritas.com/que-tanto-comen-las-aves-que-llegan-a-mi-ventana/) I wrote about it.

I am registering [this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dENiPTJtdqOiU9Oiwxen2UU2K4HP1jOR_MyGcjQP81k/edit#gid=884902643) every day when I put fruit in my window. I do it in a Google Sheets app on my cell phone.
